Auditory disabilities range from mild or moderate hearing loss in one or both ears (“hard of hearing”) to substantial and uncorrectable hearing loss in both ears (“deafness”). Some people with auditory disabilities can hear sounds but sometimes not sufficiently to understand all speech, especially when there is background noise. This can include people using hearing aids.

**Note:** This section is meant to be descriptive and does not contain a complete list of all disabilities or barriers.

## Introduction

While multimedia on the Web provides many opportunities for people with auditory disabilities, it also poses challenges when content is not designed to be accessible. For example, while video content can be used to communicate information visually, audio content needs to have alternatives, such as transcripts and captions, so that it is accessible for people with auditory disabilities.

To use the Web effectively, people with auditory disabilities often rely on:

-   Transcripts and captions of audio content, including audio-only content and audio tracks in multimedia;
-   Media players that display captions and provide options to adjust the text size and colors of captions;
-   Options to stop, pause, and adjust the volume of audio content (independently of the system volume);
-   High-quality foreground audio that is clearly distinguishable from any background noise.

For some people with auditory disabilities, sign language is the primary language, and they may not read the written language as fluently. Providing important information in sign language and using simpler text that is supplemented by images, graphs, and other illustrations help make web content more understandable to many people. However, it is important to remember that not all people with auditory disabilities know sign language.

## Examples of auditory disabilities {#examples-of-auditory-disabilities}

-   **Hard of hearing**{:#hardofhearing} – mild or moderate hearing impairments in one or both ears.
-   **Deafness**{:#deafness} – substantial, uncorrectable impairment of hearing in both ears.
-   **Deaf-blindness**{:#deafblindness} – substantial, uncorrectable hearing and visual impairments.

## Examples of barriers for people with auditory disabilities {#examples-of-barriers-for-people-with-auditory-disabilities}

-   Audio content, such as videos with voices and sounds, without captions or transcripts.
-   Media players that do not display captions and that do not provide volume controls.
-   Media players that do not provide options to adjust the text size and colors for captions.
-   Web-based services, including web applications, that rely on interaction using voice only.
-   Lack of sign language to supplement important information and text that is difficult to read.
